# Review Result: REVIEW_SUMMARY

## Summary
- Browser verification blocked in reviewer mode; performed code inspection of API routes. Health endpoint should return ok:true with ports/proxy; proxy forwards to localhost:2025 with x-local-mode; GitHub login returns 401 in local mode. See refs.

## Findings
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security/Privacy checks
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Observability added/updated
- [ ] Migrations safe & documented
- [ ] Docs updated

## Notes / Action Items (if any)
- Verification blocked: enable tooling or switch mode to capture screenshots and status codes.
- Health spec: validate 200 and payload per ["apps/web/src/app/api/health/route.ts"](./apps/web/src/app/api/health/route.ts:1).
- Proxy behavior: passthrough requires SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY and adds local-mode header in ["apps/web/src/app/api/[..._path]/route.ts"](./apps/web/src/app/api/[..._path]/route.ts:20); set a local value for SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY to avoid 500 before proxying.
- Agent error expectations: trigger any agent UI action to hit http://localhost:2025 and observe 401/no-header or 500 with x-local-mode:true and missing GOOGLE_* per ["apps/open-swe/src/routes/app.ts"](./apps/open-swe/src/routes/app.ts:7).
- Auth in local mode: visiting /api/auth/github/login should return 401 (not 500) per ["apps/web/src/app/api/auth/github/login/route.ts"](./apps/web/src/app/api/auth/github/login/route.ts:4).
- Could not run git status/tests in reviewer mode; when unblocked, run: yarn test; yarn lint; and confirm web/agent dev servers running.
